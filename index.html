            Mark’s expertise is well-known. In 2019, he gave a presentation to
            the Colorado Bar Association on Mountain Real Estate Issues. In
            2021, he presented a continuing legal education webinar on easement
            law for Half Moon Education. In 2022, he presented Easement Law for
            Surveyors at the

            Those who own property in a platted subdivision can often access
            their parcel from a public road. But for those who cannot, an
            easement may be the only way to obtain legal access to their
            property. Legal access is important because trespass is a crime and
            because a county or municipality will not issue a building permit if
            the owner does not have “legal access.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Colorado defines an easement as “an interest in property which,
            though distinct from an ownership interest in the land itself,
            nevertheless confers on the holder an enforceable right to use the
            property of another for a specific purpose.”<i>
              Wright v. Horse Creek Ranches, </i
            >697 P.2d 384, 387-388 (Colo. 1985).

            <h4>The Servient Estate and the Dominant Estate</h4>
            <p>
              The property burdened by the easement is customarily known as the
              “servient estate,” while the property benefited by the easement is
              called the “dominant estate.” Bijou Irrig. Dist. v. Empire Club,
              804 P.2d 175, 183 (Colo. 1991).
            </p>
            <p>
              The owner of the servient estate enjoys all the rights and
              benefits of proprietorship consistent with the burden of the
              easement; while the rights of the owner of the dominant estate are
              limited to those connected with use of the easement. Id. An
              easement in gross does not have a dominant estate, only a servient
              estate. Sinclair Transportation Co. v. Sandberg, 350 P.3d 924
              (Colo. App. 2014).

            <div>
              <p>
                An easement may be <strong>express</strong> or
                <strong>implied</strong>. An express easement is created by
                grant or reservation in a deed or other document. Colorado also
                recognizes various implied easements, which I discuss more fully
                below.

            <div>
              <p>
                An easement may be appurtenant or in gross. An easement
                <strong>appurtenant</strong> runs with the land and belongs to
                the owner by virtue of his or her ownership of the land the
                easement benefits. An easement in gross does not belong to an
                individual by virtue of her ownership of land, but rather is a
                personal right to use another's property. In Colorado, easements
                are presumed to be appurtenant. Lewitz v Porath Family Trust, 36
                P.3d at 120 (Colo. App. 2001).

            <div>
              <p>
                An easement may be exclusive or non-exclusive. Unless the grant
                conveying an easement specifically characterizes the easement as
                “exclusive,” the grantor of the easement retains the right to
                use the property in common with the grantee. Barnard v. Gaumer,
                146 Colo. 409, 361 P.2d 778 (1961); Bergen Ditch & Reservoir Co.
                v. Barnes, 683 P.2d 365 (Colo.App.1984).

                If the document creating the easement does not specify a
                purpose, it may allow for unlimited reasonable use.
                <i>Maasen v. Shaw</i>, 133 SW.3d 514 (Mo. App. 2004).

          <h4>Implied Easements</h4>
          <p>
            Some of the most common forms of implied easements are easements by necessity, easements implied by pre-existing use, prescriptive easements, easements by estoppel, and easements under R.S. 2477.
          </p>
          <details>
            <summary><h5>Easement by Necessity.</h5></summary>
            <div>
              <p>
                One type of implied easement is an easement by necessity. An implied way of necessity arises when the owner of a parcel of land conveys and grants part thereof to another, which leaves the remainder of the land without ingress or egress, except over the part conveyed. There are three requirements. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The first requires that the original ownership of the entire tract be held by a single grantor prior to a division thereof. The second requires that the necessity existed at the time of the severance. The third requirement is that the necessity for the particular right-of-way be great. Wagner v. Fairlamb, 379 P.2d 165 (Colo. 1963).
              </p>

            <summary><h5> Easement Implied by Pre-Existing Use</h5></summary>
            <div>
              <p>
                Another type of implied easement is an easement implied by pre-existing use. Four requirements must be met to establish an implied easement by pre-existing use: 
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>unity and subsequent separation of title</li>
                <li>obvious benefit to the dominant tenement and a burden to the servient tenement which existed at the time of the conveyance</li>
                <li>evidence that the common owner used the premises in an altered condition long enough before the conveyance to show that the change was intended to be permanent</li>
                <li>necessity for the easement. Lee v. School District, 435 P.2d 232 (Colo. 1967).</li>
              </ol>

            Mark’s expertise is well-known. In 2019, he gave a presentation to
            the Colorado Bar Association on Mountain Real Estate Issues. In
            2021,
            he presented a continuing legal education webinar on easement law
            for
            Half Moon Education. In 2022, he presented Easement Law for
            Surveyors
            at the <font color="#000000">12th Annual Rocky Mountain Surveyors
            Summit.</font></p>
            <p> Those who own
            property in a platted subdivision can often access their parcel
            from
            a public road. But for those who cannot, an easement may be the
            only
            way to obtain legal access to their property. Legal access is
            important because trespass is a crime and because a county or
            municipality will not issue a building permit if the owner does
            not
            have “legal access.”</p>
            <p> Colorado defines
            an
            easement as “an interest in property which, though distinct from
            an
            ownership interest in the land itself, nevertheless confers on the
            holder an enforceable right to use the property of another for a
            specific purpose.”<i> Wright v. Horse Creek Ranches, </i>697 P.2d
            384, 387-388 (Colo. 1985).</p>
